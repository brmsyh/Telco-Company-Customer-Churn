## Repository Outline
1. **README.md**                       - Project Overview
2. **Notebook.ipynb**   - The Python notebook contains data cleaning and statistical analysis.


## Problem Background
The telecommunications company is experiencing an elevated customer churn rate, particularly within the month-to-month contract segment. An incomplete understanding of churned customersâ€™ characteristics has hindered the design of effective retention strategies. Accordingly, this analysis was conducted to uncover patterns and key drivers of churn based on historical customer data.

## Project Output
Project outputs:
- Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses to understand churn behavior
- Interactive dashboard visualizations in Tableau Public
- Data-driven strategic recommendations to reduce churn

## Data
- Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn
- Size: 7,043 rows & 21 columns
- Key features: `Churn`, `Contract`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`, `Tenure`, `InternetService`
- Handling: Missing values in TotalCharges were removed after converting the column to a numeric type.

## Method
Main methods used in this project include:
- Descriptive Statistics: analysis of mean, median, distribution, and outliers
- Inferential Statistics: Chi-Square test to examine the relationship between churn and contract type
- Data Visualization: bar plots, boxplots, line charts, etc.

## Stacks
- `Python 3.10`
Libraries:
- `pandas`, `numpy`: for data manipulation
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: for statistical visualization

Tools:
- Tableau Public (interactive dashboard)
- Jupyter Notebook
